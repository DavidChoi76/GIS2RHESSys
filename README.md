# GIS2RHESSys

Two major functions: 1) extracting spatial information from GIS to RHESSys worldfile (RHESSys input file) and 2) calculating subsurface and surface D-inf flow distribution.

step 1:   setup/create GRASS 7.x database with downloadeded and processed elevation data. 
          elevation has to be projected to UTM and depression filled. 
step 2:   grass_cmd.sh to delinearate catchment with user provided gage location

step 3:   user needs to provide the following information:
          a)soil type (USDA classes); often based on SSURGO dataset
          b)


g2w_default:    extracting spatial information from GIS to RHESSys worldfile ;
