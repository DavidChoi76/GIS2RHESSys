# GIS2RHESSys

Two major functions: 1) extracting spatial information from GIS to RHESSys worldfile (RHESSys input file) and 2) calculating subsurface and surface D-inf flow fluxes.

Each Tool may have mutliple versions designed for different spatial resolution of the data, e.g., simply patch (patch size is sufficent to capture the spatially heterogeneous of the data), and sub-patch (a patch may contain mutliple LULC and vegetations).
